# google-script-office-app
This is a simple web app made to track employee location during the workday. Employees can clock in and out and their location will be updated dynamically. This was built on Google Apps Script and uses a simple Google Sheet as a back end.

## Background
I work on a team that is quickly expanding and is spread across two buildings. Supervisors in the organization are required to know the location of their staff at all times in case of emergency, and until recently, the team has been small enough that we were able to coordinate well enough using Google's Chat feature. However, the team has grown to nearly 40 people, so we needed some kind of formal system to track our locations. 

I decided to build this simple web app using Google's Apps Script environment, because our organization is already based on Google Cloud, making it easy to build internal tools.

This could be done with a shared spreadsheet, but I wanted to challenge myself and see how well I can make this app work within the limitations of the Apps Script environment. Plus, we have enough spreadsheets as it is!
